# WebProgramiranje1

SO, for those so inclined to reading/exploring other repositories, this one is for studies only where I have to make good use of JavaScript to decorate a website(a bit of jQuery + random library/-ies). Maybe you'll learn something, maybe not, I don't care.

Срдачан поздрав, Влајко.

So, this webpage was hosted somewhere else, and it will probably sit there collecting dust until I decide to reuse that specific URL. Even then it will keep some room on dusty old hard drive. Maybe it will be hosted here one day if any need of it appears.

Срдачан поздрав, Влајко.
