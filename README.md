# WebProgramiranje1

SO, for those so inclined to reading/exploring other repositories, this one is for studies only where I have to make good use of JavaScript to decorate a website(a bit of jQuery + random library/-ies). Maybe you'll learn something, maybe not, I don't care.

Срдачан поздрав, Влајко.

So, this webpage was hosted somewhere else, and it will probably sit there collecting dust until I decide to reuse that specific URL. Even then it will keep some room on dusty old hard drive. Maybe it will be hosted here one day if any need of it appears.

Срдачан поздрав, Влајко.

Guess what, I just found new use for another school project :D Now isn't that great. Anyways, instead of wasting another link and stuff, I've decided to dump it all here, might as well make some use of it while it's there. I've uploaded an almost raw template, as I make choices on my machine I will update(delete old and upload new) everything(well, whatever needs to be updated in the first place). As for the documentation part, it will all be made in Serbian for project requirements. If someone reads this in a few years feel free to leave a note somewhere and if you find this for aproximatelly 100 years while I'm slowly decomposing, surely Google Translate will be there to silently mistranslate whatever I just wrote. Best of luck decoding that.

Срдачан поздрав, Влајко.
